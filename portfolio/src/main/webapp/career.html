      <h1>My Career So far</h1>
      <h2><p>Career and Projects</p></h2>
      <p> I am currently studying Computer Science at Howard University. I am in my third year of college 
          and I am currently engaged in the Google STEP internship. This is my second internship at Google. Last year I was on the 
          Google Cloud Spanner team. I am interested in Web Development, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I see these as 
          the hallmarks for the future and I am excited to be a part of this. 
          I hope you enjoy my portfolio!

        <h4><a href="https://secondsongchallenge.firebaseapp.com/">3 Second Song Challenge</a></h4>
        <br>
        ● Developed using ReactJS, Firebase and Spotify developer API
        <br>
        ● This application allowed users to create challneges using their spotify library.
        <br>
        ● These challenges played a song for a specified time and then allowed the user pick the song they think was played. A high score was sent to firebase after the challeneg was played.
